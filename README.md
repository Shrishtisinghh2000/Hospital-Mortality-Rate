Project Title
Hospital Mortality Rate Analysis

Tools Used:
MS Excel
SQL
Tableau

Project Description
This project involves analyzing hospital mortality rates using SQL for data extraction and preparation, and Tableau for data visualization. The primary objective is to gain insights into the factors affecting mortality rates in hospitals, including ethnicity, BMI category, ICU type, and patient age group.

Introduction
[Dataset Used](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mitishaagarwal/patient)
This project aims to analyze hospital mortality rates using a dataset containing various patient details. The analysis focuses on understanding how different factors like ethnicity, BMI, ICU type, and age group impact hospital mortality rates.

Data Source
[SQL Code](https://github.com/Shrishtisinghh2000/Hospital-Mortality-Rate/blob/main/Hospital_Mortality_Rate.sql)
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the HospitalMortalityRateD table. This table contains patient information, including ethnicity, BMI, ICU type, length of stay, and mortality outcomes.


Tableau Dashboard
[Hospital Mortality Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/shrishti.singh1034/viz/HospitalMortalityDashboard_17165633288150/Dashboard1)
The Tableau dashboard provides a visual representation of the analysis, including:

Ethnicity Death Rate: Heatmap showing the death count for different ethnicities.
Hospital Death Statistics: Summary of overall mortality rate and total hospital deaths.
Patient Count by BMI Category: Bar chart showing patient distribution across BMI categories.
Average ICU Deaths & Survival: Bar chart showing the average length of stay in different ICU types for patients who survived and those who died.
ICU Admit Source: Pie chart showing the distribution of ICU admit sources.
Patient Count by Age Group: Treemap showing patient distribution across different age groups.

Key Insights
Ethnicity Impact: The analysis shows significant variations in death counts across different ethnicities.
BMI Influence: Patients categorized as obese or overweight have a higher patient count.
ICU Type: Certain ICU types have higher average lengths of stay for patients who died.
Age Distribution: The majority of patients fall into the 60-69 age group.

Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates how SQL and Tableau can be used together to perform a comprehensive analysis of hospital mortality rates. The insights gained can help healthcare providers understand and address factors influencing patient outcomes.
